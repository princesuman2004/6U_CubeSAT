A 1U CubeSat, also known as a 1U Cube Satellite, is a miniature satellite of standard 10cm x 10cm x 10cm cubic units. Often used in scientific, educational, and technology demonstration missions launching as secondary payloads

Goal :
To design and develop 1U Cube-SAT to measure the temperature and its altitude. Then to transmit real time data to a ground Station

Outline :
This repository contains the design and development of a 1U-Cube-SAT in a systematic apporach. The task was majorly divided into 2 parts:

Mechanical Designing and Fabrication
Avionics
Mechanical Designing and Fabrication
Dealt with Designing part of Cubesat in Fusion360 or Solidworks followed by FEA ( Either Fusion 360 or Ansys ). Major task were:

To design the 1U-Cube-SAT structure under 0.25 kg
To design the structure that is easy to assemble and integrate with other sub-systems
To perform simulations to test the structural integrity of the Cube-SAT
To design an Antenna deployment mechanism
Avionics
Major task include :

Measuring the temperature and altitude of the 1U-Cube-SAT.
Transmitting and receiving the real time data from the iU-Cube-SAT
Designing a Monopole Antenna for data-transmittion and reception at the frequency of 433 MHz
Developing the software for data processing, data transmittion and reception, Antenna Deployment
Designing the Electrical power System for the 1U-Cube-SAT
