## 6U CubeSAT
A 6U CubeSat, also known as a 6U Cube Satellite, is a miniature satellite of standard 30 cm x 20 cm x 10 cm cubic units. Often used in scientific, educational, and technology demonstration missions launching as secondary payloads

### Goal :
To design and develop 6U Cube-SAT to measure the temperature and its altitude. Then to transmit real time data to a ground Station


### Outline :
This repository contains the design and development of a 6U-Cube-SAT in a systematic apporach. The task was majorly divided into 2 parts:

1.Mechanical Designing and Fabrication
2.Avionics

### 1.Mechanical Designing and Fabrication
Dealt with Designing part of Cubesat in Fusion360 or Solidworks followed by FEA ( Either Fusion 360 or Ansys ). Major task were:
- To design the 1U-Cube-SAT structure under 0.25 kg
- To design the structure that is easy to assemble and integrate with other sub-systems
- To perform simulations to test the structural integrity of the Cube-SAT
- To design an Antenna deployment mechanism


### 2.Avionics
Major task include :
- Measuring the temperature and altitude of the 1U-Cube-SAT.
- Transmitting and receiving the real time data from the iU-Cube-SAT
- Designing a Monopole Antenna for data-transmittion and reception at the frequency of 433 MHz
- Developing the software for data processing, data transmittion and reception, Antenna Deployment
- Designing the Electrical power System for the 1U-Cube-SAT
